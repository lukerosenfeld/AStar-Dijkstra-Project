# A* & Dijkstra Pathfinding

A Java implementation of pathfinding algorithms that finds the shortest route between two locations in a graph. Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to compute distances and A* for efficient pathfinding.

**Usage**: Run `driver.java` and provide a starting location and destination when prompted. The program reads graph data from a text file and outputs the optimal path.
